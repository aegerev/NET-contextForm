This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## User Story

"If a man is hungry, I feed him! 

You can't do nothin’ on an empty stomach! When you're starving, what's better than a power meal to replenish your stamina? Rice, bread, and pasta will fill you up and give you the strength to bust out of any trouble! You eat your fill? Feelin’ better? Then let's get moving." -Sanji
